This project focuses on analyzing the Olympics Games dataset using various data visualization techniques. By leveraging the Seaborn library, I created insightful visualizations such as line charts, scatter plots, bar charts, and spectrograms to uncover trends and patterns in Olympic history. The project highlights key statistics and insights about athletes, countries, and events over time.
